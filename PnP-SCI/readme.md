Figure 1. Reconstructed large-scale `Football` video **(3840 × 1644 × 48)** using the proposed PnP-SCI algorithm with the deep denoiser [FFDNet](https://github.com/cszn/FFDNet) as the image/video prior, which is denoted as PnP-FFDNet (bottom-right). The ground truth and the results using GAP-TV (ICIP'16) are shown on the bottom-left and top-right, respectively for comparison. The captured image (top-left) size is **UHD (3840 × 1644)** and **48 frames** are recovered from **a snapshot measurement**. The `Football` video is from [a slow-motion 4K video clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGAuWZYe2No "Falcons in 4K Super Slow Motion | YouTube").

## Snapshot compressive imaging (SCI)
Snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) asks the question that can we encode multi-dimensional visual information into low-dimensional sampling. Thus, SCI refers to encoding the three- or higher- dimensional data in a snapshot with a distinct mask (or coded aperture) for each slice of the data, as shown in Fig. 2. Typical applications are high-speed imaging (with temporally-variant masks), hyperspectral imaging (with spectrally-variant masks), light-field imaging (with angularly-variant masks), and simultaneously multidimensional imaging and sensing.

Figure 2. Sensing process of video SCI (left) and the reconstruction results using the proposed PnP-FFDNet (bottom-right). The captured
image (middle-top) size is **UHD (3840 × 1644)** and **48 frames** are recovered from **a snapshot measurement**. GAP-TV (top-right) takes
180 mins and PnP-FFDNet takes 55 mins for the reconstruction. All other methods are too slow (more than 12 hours) to be used.

### Large-scale SCI
The key challenge for SCI is the trade-off of the performance in terms of reconstruction quality and speed, especially when it comes to large-scale data (eg. UHD video data here).

Plug-and-play approach uses image/video deniosers as priors. Therefore, it could bridge the image/video processing community and the inverse problem community directly. PnP-SCI enjoys this benefit. Figure 3 shows the trade-off of quality and speed of various plug-and-play denoising algorithms for SCI reconstruction.

Fig. 3.  Trade-off of quality (peak signal-to-noise ratio, PSNR in dB) and speed (1/runtime in 1/min) of various plug-and-play denoising algorithms for SCI reconstruction. The benchmark `Kobe` data (in grayscale) is used here for full comparison.

As we can see clearly, the deep denoiser FFDNet exhibits a better trade-off between the reconstruction quality and the speed. Therefore, PnP-FFDNet can be used as an *efficient baseline* in SCI reconstruction.

*Code for the video-SCI data from real systems would be available sooner.* Please refer to the readme file in the `dataset` folder for the original source(s) of both simulated and real data.

## Usage
### Download the PnP-SCI repository
0. The platform is MATLAB(R). [Parallel Computing Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/parallel-computing.html "Parallel Computing Toolbox | MathWorks(R)") (`parfor` for multi-CPU acceleration) is required to apply WNNM as the denoiser (as in DeSCI). [MatConvNet](https://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/ "MatConvNet: CNNs for MATLAB") is required to apply FFDNet as the denoiser (as in PnP-FFDNet), where compiling the GPU support is **strongly recommended**. *Note that you might find [this issue](https://github.com/vlfeat/matconvnet/issues/1143 "Problem Compiling with GPU Support on MATLAB 2018a") useful if you compile it on MATLAB 2018a and above.*
1. Download this repository via git or download the [zip file](https://github.com/liuyang12/PnP-SCI/archive/master.zip "PnP-SCI") manually.
```
git clone https://github.com/liuyang12/PnP-SCI
```

2. Download the large-scale dataset via [this link on Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6pzqxgv9aw1qqc2/AAABTmqSfTEA_i4E-p-TQJ0Sa?dl=0) or [Baidu Drive](https://pan.baidu.com/s/182-0tpxyA6_StUZZgJFsTA) (access code `d2hk`) and put the data in `./dataset/simdata/largescale`.

### Run PnP-SCI on benchmark video-SCI dataset
3. Test the PnP-SCI algorithm (on `Kobe` benchmark video-SCI dataset as default) via
```matlab
test_pnpsci
```
or (optionally) include the `dataname` when running the `test_pnpsci()` function, *i.e.*,
```matlab
test_pnpsci('traffic')
```

Note that we have decreased the number of iterations in PnP-SCI for some benchmark datasets (*e.g.*, to 5 in `Traffic` and `Crash` data, and 3 in `Aerial` data) to avoid the over-smoothing effect because of the mismatch between the estimated noise level and the real noise level for each iteration. 

### Run PnP-SCI on large-scale video-SCI dataset
4. Test the PnP-SCI algorithm (on `Messi` large-scale video-SCI dataset as default) via
```matlab
test_pnpsci_largescale
```
or (optionally) include the `dataname` when running the `test_pnpsci_largescale()` function, *i.e.*,
```matlab
test_pnpsci_largescale('football')
```

### Run full-comparison of PnP-SCI algorithms
5. [Optional] 
```matlab
tests/test_pnpsci_benchmark_full              % benchmark `Kobe` data
tests/test_pnpsci_benchmark_full('traffic')   % benchmark `Traffic` data
tests/test_pnpsci_largescale_full             % large-scale `Messi` data
tests/test_pnpsci_largescale_full('football') % large-scale `Football` datat
```

*Notice: Please donot wait for the results immediately after getting the full-comparison code to run. Because patch-based denoising priors are slow. That is why we need deep priors!*
