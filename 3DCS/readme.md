## Structure of directories

| directory  | discription  |
| :--------: | :----------: | 
| algorithms | MATLAB functions of all the algorithms applied in the project. (original) | 
| packages   | algorithms adapted from the state-of-art algorithms. (adapted)|
| scenes     | static and dynamic scenes used in the project as test images or image sequences. (standard) | 
| tests      | test code of the project applying the original functions and the adapted packages |
| utils      | utility functions for sparse reconstruction with respect to the quality and the (time) complexity of the results |

## Platform
The test platform is MATLAB(R) 2016a operating on Windows(R) 10 (x64) with an Intel(R) Core(TM) Quad CPU at 3.60 GHz and 16 GB memory.
