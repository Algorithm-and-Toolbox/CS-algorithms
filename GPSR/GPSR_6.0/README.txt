This set of MATLAB files contain an implementation of the
gradient projection algorithms described in the paper
"Gradient Projection for Sparse Reconstruction: Application
to Compressed Sensing and Other Inverse Problems"
by Mario A. T. Figueiredo, Robert D. Nowak, Stephen J. Wright,
Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing: SPecial Issue
on COnvex Optimization for Signal Processing, December 2007.
 
BOth the paper and the code are available at
http://www.lx.it.pt/~mtf/GPSR/


There are two main files (GPSR_BB.m and GPSR_BAsic.m)  which 
contain two versions of the algorithm, for solving the convex problem
min_theta = 0.5*|| y - A theta ||_2^2 + tau ||theta||_1
as described in the paper.

For usage details, type  "help GSPR_BB" or "help GSPR_Basic"
at the MATLAB prompt.


New in version 3.0: this new version includes a continuation option,
which makes the algorithm work much faster when using small values
of tau. Although it's not obvious to defined what we mean by small,
a simple rule of thumb can be to consider tau small if it is less
tham 0.05 || A^T y  ||_infinity

There are 5 demos included, four of which can be used to 
reproduce most of the figures in the paper. 

The demo "demo_image_deblur.m" requires the presence of 
the Rice wavelet toolbox somewhere on the MATLAB  path. 
This toolbox can be freely downloaded from 
http://www-dsp.rice.edu/software/rwt.shtml

This package also includes an implementation of the IST
algorithm, described in the paper
M. Figueiredo, and R. Nowak, "A Bound Optimization 
Approach to Wavelet-Based Image Deconvolution", IEEE 
International Conference on Image Processing - ICIP'2005, 
Genoa, Italy, September  2005,
which is available at
http://www.lx.it.pt/~mtf/Figueiredo_Nowak_ICIP05.pdf

Attention: the IST algorithm assumes that (and only works if)
the larges singular value of matrix A is no larger than 1.


This package also includes the l1_ls algorithm, which is
described and can be downloaded at
http://www.stanford.edu/~boyd/l1_ls/
